    <h2>Local Database transformation into OMOP-CDM</h2>
    <h2>HM Hospitales</h2>
    <p>These reports include a wide array of information vital for understanding the data's structure and content. Detailed within these reports are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Dataset Statistics</strong>: 
        Summarized statistics that give a snapshot of each dataset's size, number of records, and overall figures related data quality.</li>
    <li><strong>Value Distributions</strong>: 
        Detailed distributions of values within each dataset, highlighting common and rare occurrences.</li>
    <li><strong>Missing Data Analysis</strong>: 
        Identification and quantification of missing values, which is crucial for assessing data completeness and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Usage</strong>: 
        Analysis of the memory footprint of each dataset, providing insights into storage and processing requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Patient Demographics</strong>: 
        Comprehensive breakdowns of patient information, including date of birth and gender.</li>
    <li><strong>Types of Visits</strong>: 
        Classification and frequency of various visit types (e.g., inpatient, outpatient), including their most frequent entry and discharge types.</li>
    <li><strong>Frequencies of Conditions</strong>: 
        Analysis of medical condition prevalence.</li>
    <li><strong>Frequencies of Procedures</strong>:
         Detailed examination of instances of medical procedures that take place within our facilities.
        </li>
    <li><strong>Frequencies of Treatments</strong>: 
        Insight into treatments administered by medical personnel within our facilities, highlighting distinct treatments and their overall frequency in medical visits.</li>
</ul>

<p>These detailed insights are critical for the efficient exploration and analysis of the data, ensuring a thorough understanding before it is transformed into standardized concepts using the OMOP-CDM guidelines.</p>
