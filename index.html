    <h1>Data Profiling Links</h1>
    <h2>Local Database transformation into OMOP-CDM</h2>
    <h2>HM Hospitales</h2>
    <p>This page provides links to various data profiling reports from HM Hospitales' local database. The primary objective of these data profiling reports is to offer a comprehensive overview of the data that will undergo transformation through ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) format.

        These reports include a wide array of information vital for understanding the data's structure and content. Detailed within these reports are:
        
        - **Dataset Statistics**: Summarized statistics that give a snapshot of each dataset's size, number of records, and overall data quality.
        - **Value Distributions**: Detailed distributions of values within each dataset, highlighting common and rare occurrences.
        - **Missing Data Analysis**: Identification and quantification of missing values, which is crucial for assessing 
        data completeness and reliability.
        - **Memory Usage**: Analysis of the memory footprint of each dataset, providing insights into storage and processing requirements.
        - **Patient Demographics**: Comprehensive breakdowns of patient information, including age, gender, and other relevant demographic details.
        - **Types of Visits**: Classification and frequency of various visit types (e.g., inpatient, outpatient), including their most frequent entry and discharge types.
        - **Frequencies of Conditions**: Analysis of condition prevalence, detailing the most common and rare conditions observed in the dataset.
        - **Frequencies of Procedures**: Detailed examination of procedures, including their frequency and types.
        - **Frequencies of Treatments**: Insight into treatment data, highlighting common treatments administered by medical personnel.
        
        These detailed insights are critical for the efficient exploration and analysis of the data, ensuring a thorough understanding before it is transformed into standardized concepts using the OMOP-CDM guidelines.
